# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

This program implements the A* Pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest distance between two nodes.

## Usage

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer before downloading pygame via the terminal.
```python
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```
Run the .py file after optimizing all imports via an IDE to see the GUI.

To play the game:
- The first click positions your starting node at the location of the mouse on the grid.
- The second click positions your end node at the location of the mouse on the grid.
- Every click after the nodes are placed are barrier nodes that the path must circumvent
- Click the "space" key to begin the A* algorithm
- Click "c" to clear the GUI and restart the game. 

## Features

This program runs the A* Pathfinding algorithm between two nodes that are set by the user.

## Project Status

Front end application is completely built. I am currently in the process of adding more algorithms (Dijkstra Algorithm, Swarm Algorithm).
